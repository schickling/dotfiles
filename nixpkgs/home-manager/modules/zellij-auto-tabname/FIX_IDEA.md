Below is a condensed “field-guide” to what is tripping people up with Zellij 0.42.x plugins, why you’re getting the red “ERROR IN PLUGIN – check logs for more info” banner and a disappearing tab-bar, and — most importantly — what you can do right now to get dynamic tab-titles working again.

1 | What’s really going wrong?

Symptom	Likely root cause	Where it is tracked
Red “ERROR IN PLUGIN” in the skinny 1-row pane that was supposed to host your plugin; tab-bar vanishes	The plugin crashed before first render – Zellij swaps in an error message in that pane, and because your layout never added the normal tab-bar plugin you think it “disappeared”.	Upstream issue #3721 – status-bar plugin also shows identical failure pattern  ￼
Crash happens even with a minimal plugin (no permissions, no logic)	The module is rejected by Wasmtime (Zellij’s WASM runtime) because it contains the “typed function references” feature that Rust ≥ 1.80 emits by default. Wasmtime < 24 rejects it with “zero byte expected” or WebAssembly translation error.	Wasmtime bug #9130, linked from Zellij issue #3719  ￼
Same error only when you open a second tab	Zellij loads the same WASM a second time → double memory reservation → failure on constrained systems	Zellij bug #3864 (“Failing to reserve memory …”)  ￼
You can’t find the log	Plugin STDERR is in /tmp/zellij-<UID>/zellij-log/zellij.log (macOS: /var/folders/…/T/…)  ￼	

Why it suddenly started after April 2025
	•	Rust 1.84 turned typed-function-references on by default for WASI/WASIP1 targets.
	•	Zellij 0.42.2 updated wit/wasm-parser to cope with that, but only if you build against the exact same Wasmtime version bundled into 0.42.2. Any newer Rust (1.85-nightly) or certain optimisation flags can still emit section layouts Wasmtime 23 rejects, so you can reproduce the crash even on 0.42.2.  ￼

2 | Fix or work-around checklist

Step	What to do	Why
A. Confirm logs	tail -f $(mktemp -d)/zellij-log/zellij.log while reproducing	You’ll see Wasmtime complaining about “zero byte expected”, “function_refs”, or memory allocation
B. Pin toolchain	```bash	
rustup override set 1.83.1 # pre function-ref default		
cargo clean		
cargo build –release –target wasm32-wasip1		

| **C. Or compile with feature flag off** | `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-reference-types"` | Keeps current toolchain but turns the feature off |
| **D. Trim the WASM** | `wasm-tools strip target/…/*.wasm` | Smaller module → avoids mmap-failure on memory-constrained systems (#3864) |
| **E. Load the plugin only **once** per tab** | *Either* use **`default_tab_template`** *or* the top-level `plugins{}` block, **not both**. Duplicating it gives you two plugin panes and two loads. |
| **F. Put the real tab-bar back** | After the plugin pane, add the built-in `tab-bar` plugin (or the community `zjstatus`) so you still see the bar even if your own plugin crashes. |
| **G. Use Zellij ≥ 0.43 when it lands** | The dev branch already bumps Wasmtime 24 and no longer crashes on typed-function-refs; waiting for the release is the long-term fix. |

## 3 | Minimal “known-good” dynamic-title plugin

```rust
// Cargo.toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
[dependencies]
zellij-tile = "0.42"      # exactly match your zellij version

// src/lib.rs
use std::collections::BTreeMap;
use zellij_tile::prelude::*;

struct AutoTab; impl Default for AutoTab { fn default() -> Self { Self } }
register_plugin!(AutoTab);

impl ZellijPlugin for AutoTab {
    fn load(&mut self, _cfg: BTreeMap<String,String>) {
        request_permission(&[
            PermissionType::ReadApplicationState,
            PermissionType::ChangeApplicationState,
        ]);
        subscribe(&[EventType::PaneUpdate]);
    }

    fn update(&mut self, ev: Event) -> bool {
        if let Event::PaneUpdate(m) = ev {
            for (tab, panes) in m.panes {
                if let Some(p) = panes.into_iter().find(|p| p.is_focused && !p.title.is_empty()) {
                    let wanted = format!("> {}", p.title);
                    rename_tab(tab, &wanted);
                }
            }
        }
        true
    }

    fn render(&mut self, _rows: usize, _cols: usize) {
        print!("\u{2800}"); // invisible braille char; avoids empty-render panic
    }
}

Build:

rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
cargo +1.83.1 build --release --target wasm32-wasip1

Copy target/wasm32-wasip1/release/auto_tab.wasm to ~/.config/zellij/plugins/.

4 | Sanity-check layout (single load, keeps tab-bar)

layout {
  default_tab_template {
    // 1-line background plugin pane
    pane size=1 borderless=true { plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/auto_tab.wasm" }
    // built-in bar so we *see* the titles
    pane size=1 borderless=true { plugin name="tab-bar" }
    children
  }
  tab name="Main" focus=true   // main tab
}

Launch: zellij --layout ~/.config/zellij/layouts/dynamic_tab.kdl

⸻

5 | Shell hooks that still work (fallback / complement)

Even if the plugin is down, you can always rename the tab from the shell:

# ~/.zshrc
function osc_title() { printf "\033]0;%s\007" "$1"; }
if [[ -n $ZELLIJ ]]; then
  autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook
  add-zsh-hook preexec 'osc_title "$1"'          # running cmd
  add-zsh-hook precmd  'osc_title "${PWD##*/}"'  # idle dir
fi

That alone will set pane titles; with the fixed plugin the titles propagate to the tab; without it you can still fall back to:

function rename_tab() { zellij action rename-tab "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1 }
add-zsh-hook preexec 'rename_tab "$1"'
add-zsh-hook precmd  'rename_tab "${PWD##*/}"'

6 | Testing matrix (quick scriptable checks)

Scenario	Expectation
ls (quick cmd)	Tab briefly shows > ls, then > project-dir
sleep 5	Shows > sleep for 5 s, reverts
In Vim :set title editing files	Tab updates to > vim – myfile.rs on each switch
Two panes, focus swap	Tab title toggles between each pane’s title
Open second tab via same layout	Each tab keeps its own independent auto-title
Build the plugin with Rust 1.85 without flag	Crash reproduces – good regression test


⸻

TL;DR

The crash is almost always Wasmtime rejecting newer WASM features.
Pin Rust ≤ 1.83 or compile with -C target-feature=-reference-types, load the plugin once per tab, keep the real tab-bar in your layout, and you should have stable, real-time tab names again. As soon as Zellij 0.43 ships with an updated Wasmtime, you can drop the compilation work-around.
